# HOPE - Oma ilmanlaatu

[![On-Push Tests](https://github.com/uselesscompany/hope-oma-ilmanlaatu-app/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uselesscompany/hope-oma-ilmanlaatu-app/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository contains the source code for the HOPE - Oma ilmanlaatu (My Air Quality) app. (https://hope.useless.fi)

My Air Quality is an experiment based on Healthy Outdoor Premises for Everyone HOPE project. The goal is to improve the air quality in Helsinki by offering citizens different ways of reducing their personal emissions affecting the air quality, and by offering a chance to decide which actions to execute in neighborhoods, and to offer a way to present action ideas for other citizens and for the city of Helsinki.

During the active campaigning phase the software had also a feature to allow citizens to vote for actions, but this version does not include that anymore, but is rather focused on allowing users to test out how their actions affect the air quality, and show them suggestions on what they could do to improve it.
